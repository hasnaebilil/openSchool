                                <p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is
                                    to store
                                    multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the
                                    position of
                                    each
                                    element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the
                                    first
                                    element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The base value is
                                    index 0
                                    and
                                    the difference between the two indexes is the offset.</p>

                                <p>For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is
                                    placed a
                                    value (let’s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of
                                    your
                                    friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on. </p>
